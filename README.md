# COVID-19 Stats Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **Covid-19 Stats.ipynb**, which performs exploratory data analysis on global and regional COVID-19 statistics. The project focuses on understanding the spread, trends, and impact of COVID-19 using publicly available datasets.

The notebook includes:

* Data loading and cleaning
* Exploratory data analysis
* Visualization of trends such as confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities
* Country-level comparisons
* Time series insights

## Objectives

* Analyze global COVID-19 case trends over time
* Compare confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across countries
* Identify peak periods and flattening patterns
* Study regional impact and severity levels

## Key Features

### **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**

* Handling missing values
* Renaming inconsistent columns
* Aggregating data by date and country
* Converting date columns into proper datetime format

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Case progression over time
* Active vs recovered vs fatality distribution
* Top affected countries by case count
* Daily new cases and moving averages

### **3. Visualizations**

The notebook includes clear and interactive visualizations such as:

* Line charts for time-series analysis
* Bar graphs for country-wise comparisons
* Pie charts for proportional case distribution
* Heatmaps or trend visuals depending on dataset availability
